Abstract. An innovative peer-to-peer system that is based on Satoshi Nakamoto's idea to continue on the tradition of cryptocurrency transfers in the absence of a financial institution.
Each account has a globally available nonce that prohibits same-chain replay and double-spending threats.
The nonce is the sequence number that miners examine since a block with an insufficient nonce is an invalid block.
To avoid fraudster interactions, LiLGcoin has incorporated functionalities such as Pause (Certain functions in the contract), Freeze (Accounts), Burn (Fraudulent coins), and ReentrancyGuard (Modifier that prevents reentrancy).
